To correctly see your pet you need to reselect it in the "Pets" menu  
When first launching the game open your skill menu to register your current Taming level

# Commands
Use command: "/petinfo -gui" to change the text location  
Use command: "/petinfo -display <icon / text>" to change the display to only text or icon

# Credit
Big thank you to Biscuit (+ every contributor) and symt for their work and their projects.
As I have never made a Minecraft mod, their repos were a huge learning resource and were used as a refrenece for a lot of things.
The new pet progress display was inspired by Powns skyblock exp tracker
